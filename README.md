Based on your screenshot, I can see you have a well-organized dev-guides repository with the following structure:

```
dev-guides/
├── prompts/
├── setup/
│   ├── docker-guide.md
│   ├── git-gh-dev-guide.md
│   └── local-dev-setup.md
└── README.md
```

Here's an updated README that matches your current structure:
